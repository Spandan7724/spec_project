# Currency Conversion Timing Advisor - Complete Project Architecture

## Project Vision
Build a comprehensive AI-powered system that helps users make informed decisions about currency conversion timing through intelligent market analysis and personalized recommendations.

## Target Users
- **Individuals/Travelers**: Converting money for trips with flexible timelines
- **Business Owners**: Regular international payments and supplier transactions  
- **Regular Senders**: Monthly remittances to family/friends abroad

## Core Value Proposition
Instead of converting at current rates, users get:
- **Dynamic conversion plans**: When exactly to convert for optimal savings
- **Market reasoning**: Clear explanations based on economic events and trends
- **Real-time updates**: Plans adjust as market conditions change
- **Risk-adjusted advice**: Customizable complexity and risk tolerance
- **Clear signals**: "Convert now" or "Wait" with confidence scores

## Major System Components

### 1. Data Collection & Integration
- **Real-time Exchange Rates** - Multiple currency provider APIs (Fixer, Alpha Vantage, etc.)
- **Economic Calendar** - Central bank meetings, GDP releases, inflation data (FRED API)
- **Financial News** - Reuters, Bloomberg feeds for market-moving news
- **Market Data** - Historical prices, volatility, volume data
- **Provider Rates** - Conversion fees from banks, Wise, Revolut, etc.

### 2. Price Prediction Tool (ML-based)

- **Forecast Models** - LSTM, ARIMA, transformers for short-horizon predictions
- **Inputs** - Historical rates, volatility, macro events, news sentiment
- **Outputs** - Probability of up/down movement, predicted ranges (p10/p50/p90)
- **Agent Integration** - Exposed as a tool for planner agents to call when deciding Convert vs Wait
- **Fallbacks** - Use technical indicators (moving averages, volatility bands) if ML predictions unavailable


### 3. AI/LLM Integration
- **LLM Provider Management** - OpenAI, Anthropic, local models
- **Prompt Engineering** - Structured prompts for different analysis types
- **Response Processing** - Parse and validate LLM outputs
- **Cost Management** - Track API usage and costs

### 4. Multi-Agent System (LangGraph)
- **Agent Architecture** - Individual specialized agents
- **Workflow Orchestration** - LangGraph state management and routing
- **Agent Communication** - Data passing between agents
- **Error Handling** - Failed agents, retries, fallbacks

### 5. Analysis & Prediction Engine
- **Technical Analysis** - RSI, moving averages, support/resistance
- **Fundamental Analysis** - Economic indicator impact assessment
- **Sentiment Analysis** - News and social media sentiment scoring
- **Risk Assessment** - Volatility, drawdown, scenario analysis
- **Timing Optimization** - Optimal conversion windows and strategies

### 6. Decision & Recommendation System
- **Strategy Generation** - Single vs multi-tranche conversion plans
- **Risk-Adjusted Recommendations** - Based on user risk tolerance
- **Confidence Scoring** - How certain the system is about recommendations
- **Reasoning & Explanation** - Clear justification for decisions

### 7. Data Storage & Caching
- **Rate History Storage** - Historical exchange rate data
- **User Request Tracking** - Active conversion plans and preferences
- **Prediction Cache** - Store and reuse analysis results
- **Performance Metrics** - Track recommendation accuracy

### 8. Real-time Monitoring & Updates
- **Market Change Detection** - Significant rate movements or news
- **Plan Updates** - Dynamic re-optimization of strategies
- **Alert System** - When to execute conversions
- **Event Tracking** - Monitor economic calendar events

### 9. API & Integration Layer
- **REST API** - Endpoints for frontend/mobile apps
- **Webhook System** - Real-time notifications and updates
- **Provider Integration** - Direct connections to currency services
- **Authentication** - API keys, user authentication

### 10. Configuration & Settings
- **User Preferences** - Risk tolerance, notification preferences
- **System Configuration** - API keys, model settings, thresholds
- **Feature Flags** - Enable/disable components for testing

### 11. Testing & Validation
- **Unit Tests** - Individual component testing
- **Integration Tests** - End-to-end workflow testing
- **Backtesting** - Validate predictions against historical data
- **Performance Monitoring** - System health and accuracy metrics

### 12. Logging & Observability
- **Application Logging** - System events and errors
- **Performance Metrics** - Response times, success rates
- **User Analytics** - Usage patterns and outcomes
- **Debugging Tools** - Trace request flows through agents

### 13. Infrastructure & Deployment
- **Environment Management** - Dev/staging/production configs
- **Dependency Management** - Package versions and updates
- **Security** - API key management, data encryption
- **Scalability** - Handle multiple concurrent users
