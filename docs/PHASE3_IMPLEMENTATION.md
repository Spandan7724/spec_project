# Phase 3 Implementation Summary

Concise overview of Phase 3 (Layer 3): Decision Engine — utility‑based recommendation with staging, risk/cost evaluation, optional heuristics as last resort, and LangGraph node integration.

## Phases Implemented
- 3.1 Decision Model Core
- 3.2 Staging Algorithm
- 3.3 Heuristic Fallbacks (rare use; disabled by default)
- 3.4 Decision Engine Node & Orchestration

## Files Created (by phase)

### 3.1 Decision Model Core
- `src/decision/models.py` — Data contracts for request/response, tranches, risk, costs.
- `src/decision/config.py` — Decision config loader (risk profiles, thresholds, staging, costs, heuristics policy).
- `src/decision/utility_scorer.py` — Utility scoring for convert_now/staged/wait (improvement, risk, cost, urgency).
- `src/decision/risk_calculator.py` — Risk summary from ATR + event proximity (vol, VaR, event risk).
- `tests/decision/test_utility_scorer.py` — Utility scoring tests.
- `tests/decision/test_risk_calculator.py` — Risk summary tests.

### 3.2 Staging Algorithm
- `src/decision/staging_planner.py` — Tranche count, sizing, spacing, event‑aware shifts; rationale & extra cost.
- `src/decision/cost_calculator.py` — Spread/fee cost with staging multiplier.
- `tests/decision/test_staging_planner.py` — Planner behavior and edge cases.
- `tests/decision/test_cost_calculator.py` — Cost calculations.

### 3.3 Heuristic Fallbacks
- `src/decision/heuristics.py` — Event gating + RSI/MACD/trend rules; urgency override; conservative bias.
- `src/decision/confidence_aggregator.py` — Aggregates component confidences + global penalties.
- `tests/decision/test_heuristics.py` — Heuristic rules tests.
- `tests/decision/test_confidence_aggregator.py` — Confidence aggregation tests.

### 3.4 Decision Engine Node & Integration
- `src/decision/decision_maker.py` — Orchestrates scoring, staging, costs, confidence, rationale, warnings.
- `src/agentic/nodes/decision.py` — LangGraph node; builds request, returns recommendation + evidence/meta for UI.
- `tests/decision/test_decision_maker.py` — Utility path, event gating, expected outcome tests.
- `tests/unit/test_agentic/test_nodes/test_decision.py` — Node update and shape checks.
- `scripts_test/test_phase_3.py` — E2E runner printing decision, rationale, and structured evidence JSON.

## Config Updates
- `config.yaml`
  - `decision:` risk_profiles, thresholds, staging, costs; `heuristics.enabled=false` (default), `trigger_policy=strict`.
  - `prediction.explain_enabled=true` (top features for UI evidence); `timestamp` added in prediction node payload.

## Phase Outcome
- Layer 3 complete:
  - Utility‑based recommendation (convert_now/staged/wait) with risk/cost/urgency trade‑offs.
  - Staging plans with event awareness and cost estimate.
  - Confidence aggregation across market/intelligence/prediction.
  - Heuristic fallback is disabled by default and only used as a last resort if enabled.
  - Decision node integrated into the LangGraph workflow; Phase 3 runner demonstrates end‑to‑end outputs with evidence.
