# Provider Cost Analysis - Implementation Challenges

## Problem Statement

**Goal**: Get real transfer costs (not just exchange rates) to compare total costs across providers.

**Challenge**: Transfer quote calculators are protected behind authentication/interactive forms.

## What We Actually Need

```
Provider    | Send     | Receive   | Effective Rate | Total Cost
------------|----------|-----------|----------------|------------
Mid-Market  | $1000    | ‚Ç¨855.80   | 0.85580        | $0 (baseline)
Wise        | $1000    | ‚Ç¨847.23   | 0.84723        | $10.02 
Bank        | $1000    | ‚Ç¨820.45   | 0.82045        | $41.23
Remitly     | $1000    | ‚Ç¨842.10   | 0.84210        | $15.94
```

## Testing Results

### ‚ùå **Official APIs - Require Business Accounts**
- Wise Platform API: 401 Unauthorized
- Revolut Business API: 401 Unauthorized  
- XE.com Professional API: 401 Unauthorized

### ‚ùå **Direct Quote Calculator URLs - Protected**
- All providers return 404/301 for direct calculator access
- Quote systems require interactive form submission
- No direct URL access to cost breakdowns

### ‚úÖ **Currency Converter Pages - Only Exchange Rates**
- XE.com: Gets mid-market rates (0.855799) but no fees
- Wise: Basic converter accessible but no transfer costs
- **Problem**: Converters ‚â† Transfer quotes

## Alternative Implementation Approaches

### **1. Headless Browser Automation** ü§ñ
**Method**: Use Playwright to interact with quote forms
- Fill amount fields programmatically
- Submit forms and scrape results
- Extract "send X receive Y" data

**Pros**: Can get real quotes with fees
**Cons**: Complex, may break with UI changes, potential ToS issues

### **2. Third-party Comparison APIs** üîó
**Method**: Use aggregation services
- CompareRemit API
- MoneyTransfers.com data
- TransferGo comparison tools

**Pros**: Legal, maintained by others
**Cons**: May have limited coverage, additional costs

### **3. Static Fee Documentation** üìä
**Method**: Use published fee schedules
- Bank wire fees: $40-50 + 3-5% markup (documented)
- Wise fees: Published rate + small fixed fee
- Revolut: Published margin rates

**Pros**: Reliable baseline, no scraping issues
**Cons**: Less precise, may not reflect real-time costs

### **4. Hybrid Approach** üîÑ
**Method**: Combine multiple methods
- Use static fees for banks (well-documented)
- Web scraping for accessible providers
- API integration where available

## Recommendation

**Start with Static Fee Documentation** for initial implementation:
- Banks: Use documented wire fees + exchange markups
- Wise/Revolut: Use published fee structures
- Add real-time scraping later as enhancement

This provides immediate value while avoiding complex automation challenges.

## Next Steps

1. Research published fee schedules for major providers
2. Implement static cost calculator
3. Test with real scenarios
4. Consider headless automation for Phase 2 enhancement
