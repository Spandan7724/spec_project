## IV. Research Objectives

This research aims to develop an intelligent currency exchange timing recommendation system for retail users. The specific objectives are:

1. **Develop accurate forecasting models** that predict currency price movements across multiple time horizons with substantially higher accuracy than existing methods.

2. **Integrate multiple data sources** including real-time market prices, technical indicators, financial news, and economic events into a unified analytical framework.

3. **Implement personalized decision-making** that generates timing recommendations adapted to individual risk tolerance, time constraints, and transaction sizes.

4. **Ensure transparency and explainability** by providing clear explanations for predictions and recommendations that non-expert users can understand.

5. **Achieve real-time performance** suitable for interactive use while performing comprehensive market analysis.

6. **Validate practical effectiveness** through rigorous testing including prediction accuracy evaluation, decision quality assessment, and user satisfaction studies.
