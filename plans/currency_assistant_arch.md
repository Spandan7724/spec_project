## Architecture Overview

### Design Philosophy

This multi-agent system follows a **Supervisor Pattern** with specialized sub-agents, where each agent has distinct responsibilities and expertise. The architecture prioritizes:

- **Functional Specialization**: Each agent serves a specific, valuable purpose
- **Parallel Processing**: Independent agents work simultaneously for efficiency
- **Scalability**: Easy to add/remove agents without system-wide changes
- **Simplicity**: Streamlined from 8 to 5 core agents for faster development
- **Stateless Operation**: Runtime parameters instead of persistent user profiles
- **Research-Backed Design**: Based on proven forex trading and financial AI systems

## LangGraph Implementation Pattern

### Graph Structure

The system uses a **layered execution pattern** with parallel and sequential processing:

**Layer 1 (Parallel)**: Data collection and analysis
- Market Data Agent
- Market Intelligence Agent

**Layer 2 (Sequential)**: Prediction based on Layer 1 data
- Price Prediction Agent (waits for Layer 1)

**Layer 3 (Sequential)**: Final decision
- Decision Engine Agent (waits for all previous layers)

### Node Definitions

Each agent is a node in the LangGraph:

- **supervisor_start**: Entry point, NLU and parameter extraction
- **market_data**: Fetches real-time market data
- **market_intelligence**: Analyzes fundamentals and sentiment
- **price_prediction**: ML-based forecasting
- **decision_engine**: Risk assessment and timing optimization
- **supervisor_end**: Response generation and user output

### Conditional Routing

The Supervisor uses conditional edges to:
- Skip agents if data is unavailable
- Retry on specific errors
- Abort on critical failures
- Route to clarification if query is ambiguous

### State Persistence

State flows through the graph and is updated by each agent. All agents read from and write to the shared state object.

---

## State Management Schema

### Core State Structure

The state object contains:

**User Query Information**:
- Original user query text
- Parsed currency pair
- Conversion amount
- Runtime parameters (risk_tolerance, urgency, timeframe)

**Agent Outputs**:
- market_data: Current rates, spreads, technical indicators
- market_intelligence: Unified fundamental + sentiment score
- price_prediction: Forecasts with confidence intervals
- decision: Final recommendation with reasoning

**Metadata**:
- Timestamp
- Request ID
- Processing times per agent
- Error log
- Agent execution status
- Warnings and caveats

### Runtime Parameters

Instead of a persistent user profile, parameters are passed at runtime:

**risk_tolerance**: "conservative" | "moderate" | "aggressive"
- Conservative: Max 5% drawdown, 80%+ confidence required
- Moderate: Max 10% drawdown, 65%+ confidence required  
- Aggressive: Max 15% drawdown, 55%+ confidence required

**urgency**: "urgent" | "normal" | "flexible"
- Urgent: Execute immediately unless very negative signal
- Normal: Standard optimization
- Flexible: Wait for optimal conditions

**timeframe**: "immediate" | "1_day" | "1_week" | "1_month"
- Immediate: Execute within current trading session
- 1_day: Optimize for next 24 hours
- 1_week: Consider weekly trends
- 1_month: Factor in longer-term patterns

**amount**: float
- Conversion amount (required)
- Used for position sizing and transaction cost calculations

### State Evolution Example

**Initial State** (after Supervisor parsing):
```
{
  "currency_pair": "USD/EUR",
  "amount": 5000,
  "risk_tolerance": "moderate",
  "urgency": "flexible",
  "timeframe": "1_week",
  "errors": [],
  "agent_status": {}
}
```

**After Market Data Agent**:
```
{
  ...(previous fields),
  "market_data": {
    "current_rate": 0.9234,
    "bid": 0.9232,
    "ask": 0.9236,
    "spread": 0.0004,
    "rsi": 58.3,
    "macd": "bullish",
    ...
  },
  "agent_status": {"market_data": "success"}
}
```

**After Market Intelligence Agent**:
```
{
  ...(previous fields),
  "market_intelligence": {
    "overall_score": 6.5,
    "fundamental_score": 7.0,
    "sentiment_score": 0.6,
    "confidence": 0.78,
    "key_factors": [...]
  },
  "agent_status": {"market_data": "success", "market_intelligence": "success"}
}
```

**After Price Prediction Agent**:
```
{
  ...(previous fields),
  "price_prediction": {
    "24h_forecast": 0.9245,
    "7d_forecast": 0.9280,
    "confidence_95": [0.9220, 0.9270],
    "trend": "bullish",
    "volatility": "moderate"
  },
  "agent_status": {..., "price_prediction": "success"}
}
```

**Final State (after Decision Engine)**:
```
{
  ...(all previous fields),
  "decision": {
    "action": "WAIT",
    "confidence": 72,
    "timing": "wait_24_48_hours",
    "reasoning": "Prediction shows 0.5% improvement potential...",
    "expected_rate": 0.9245,
    "risk_metrics": {...},
    "alternatives": [...]
  },
  "agent_status": {..., "decision_engine": "success"}
}
```

## Communication Protocols

### Inter-Agent Communication

**Principle**: Agents communicate exclusively through shared state. No direct agent-to-agent messaging.

**Benefits**:
- Simplified debugging and monitoring
- Clear data lineage
- Easy to replay and test
- Prevents context window clutter
- Natural audit trail

### Standard Agent Output Format

All agents return outputs in a consistent structure:

**Fields**:
- **status**: "success" | "error" | "partial"
- **data**: Agent-specific output dictionary
- **confidence**: 0.0-1.0 (agent's confidence in its output)
- **processing_time_ms**: Execution time in milliseconds
- **warnings**: List of warning messages
- **metadata**: Version info, models used, data sources, etc.

### Error Handling Strategy

**Graceful Degradation**: System continues with partial results when possible

**Error Levels**:
- **Critical**: Must abort (e.g., invalid currency pair, no data sources available)
- **Major**: Continue with fallback (e.g., one data provider down, use cached data)
- **Minor**: Log warning, proceed normally (e.g., sentiment data delayed)

**Fallback Strategies**:
- Market Data fails → Use cached data (warn user about staleness)
- Market Intelligence fails → Proceed without fundamental/sentiment input
- Price Prediction fails → Use simple moving average baseline
- Decision Engine fails → Provide basic recommendation with low confidence

**Error Response to User**:
- Clear explanation of what went wrong
- Indication of what data is missing
- Reduced confidence in recommendation
- Suggestion to retry or contact support

### Timeout Management

Each agent has a maximum execution time:

- Market Data Agent: 3 seconds
- Market Intelligence Agent: 5 seconds  
- Price Prediction Agent: 10 seconds
- Decision Engine Agent: 3 seconds
- Total system timeout: 25 seconds

If timeout occurs:
- Agent returns partial results if available
- System proceeds to next agent with warning
- Confidence levels are reduced
- User is informed of incomplete analysis

---

## Data Flow Architecture

### Request Flow

**Step-by-Step Process**:

1. **User Query Received**
   - User submits natural language query
   - Supervisor Agent receives request

   - Validate parameters
   - Handle ambiguity with clarifying questions

3. **Layer 1: Parallel Data Collection**
   - Dispatch simultaneously:
     - Market Data Agent
     - Market Intelligence Agent
   - Both agents execute independently
   - Wait for both to complete (or timeout)

4. **Layer 2: Price Prediction**
   - Price Prediction Agent receives:
     - Market data from Layer 1
     - Market intelligence from Layer 1
   - Generates forecasts
   - Calculates confidence intervals

5. **Layer 3: Decision Making**
   - Decision Engine Agent receives:
     - All Layer 1 data
     - Price predictions
     - Runtime user parameters
   - Performs risk assessment
   - Optimizes timing
   - Generates recommendation

6. **Response Generation**
   - Supervisor consolidates all outputs
   - Formats user-friendly response
   - Includes:
     - Clear action recommendation
     - Explanation and reasoning
     - Confidence level
     - Risk metrics
     - Alternative scenarios
   - Returns to user

**Total Flow Time**: Target < 5 seconds for standard queries

### Data Persistence

**Database Schema** (SQLite):

**Tables**:

1. **conversations**
   - Tracks conversation sessions
   - Fields: id, session_id, query, response, timestamp, user_params

2. **prediction_history**
   - Stores predictions for accuracy tracking
   - Fields: id, currency_pair, prediction_horizon, predicted_rate, confidence, actual_rate, prediction_time, evaluation_time

3. **agent_metrics**
   - Performance monitoring
   - Fields: id, agent_name, execution_time_ms, status, error_message, timestamp

4. **system_logs**
   - Audit trail and debugging
   - Fields: id, request_id, log_level, message, agent, timestamp

**Caching**: In-memory Python dict with TTL for market data (no Redis needed)
**No User Profile Tables**: System is stateless, no persistent user data
**Upgrade Path**: SQLAlchemy ORM makes switching to PostgreSQL easy if needed later

### Caching Strategy

**In-Memory Cache** (Python-based with TTL):

1. **Hot Cache** (TTL: 5 seconds)
   - Current exchange rates for major pairs (EUR/USD, GBP/USD, etc.)
   - Latest market intelligence scores
   - Real-time technical indicators

2. **Warm Cache** (TTL: 1 minute)
   - Recent price predictions
   - Sentiment scores
   - News summaries

3. **Cold Cache** (TTL: 1 hour)
   - Historical economic data
   - Fundamental analysis results
   - Model outputs

**Implementation**:
- Simple Python dict with expiration timestamps
- Can use `functools.lru_cache` for function-level caching
- Thread-safe with proper locking

**Cache Invalidation**:
- Time-based expiration (TTL)
- Event-based invalidation (major news, rate changes > 0.5%)
- Manual invalidation for critical updates

**Performance Impact**:
- Cache hit rate target: > 80% for hot cache
- Average response time improvement: 50-70%
- Reduced API costs: 60-80%

**Upgrade Path**: Can switch to Redis later if multiple processes needed
